        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2><img src="images/football.svg" alt="">Who Am I?<img src="images/gym.svg" alt=""></h2>
        <p>Greetings! My name is Adam, allow me to tell you a little bit about myself. I'm a 21 year old from Sydney, currently studying a Diploma of Information Technology at Coder Academy. Some of my passions include sport, fitness, gaming, travelling, collecting watches, cryptocurrency and NFT's. My latest mission in life is to become proficient in full-stack web development in pursuit of a full-time career as a developer - I'm really enjoying the journey so far and cannot wait for what the future holds.</p>
        <h2><img src="images/briefcase.svg" alt=""/>Previous Experience<img src="images/study.svg" alt=""></h2>
        <p>I have 3 years experience in the finance and accounting industry. Straight out of highschool, I was recruited as a Junior Analyst in Global Mobility Tax. As part of the client service team, we assisted in managing the tax affairs of both inbound and outbound Australian expatriates. In particular, it was my responsibility to prepare a variety of deliverables such as; Australian income tax returns, domestic payroll, shadow payroll, tax briefings, tax equalisation calculations as well as liasing with the ATO on behalf of our clients.</p>

        <h2><img src="images/crypto.svg" alt=""/>Transition to Coding<img src="images/controller.svg" alt=""></h2>
        <p>After 3 years at my previous job and many hours of careful consideration, I decided it was time for a change. I found my job to be very unfulfilling and I couldn't realistically picture myself enjoying a long-term career in that industry. Since a kid, I've always loved playing video games - my most fond gaming memories were from games like Runescape, Skyrim and Fallout. A couple years ago I started to involve myself in the cryptocurrency space (and more recently NFT's), and as I delved deeper into the rabbit hole of blockchain technology, I found a true passion for the Web 3.0 industry. Having been surrounded by technology my whole life, I decided to dabble with coding in my spare time and I really enjoyed it. I particularly enjoyed the problem-solving and creativity aspects of coding. So recently I decided to take the leap, quit my job, and commit myself fully to the Coder Academy bootcamp with the aspirations of become a developer.</p>
